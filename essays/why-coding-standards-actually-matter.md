## First Impressions
When I first heard about coding standards, I honestly didn’t think much of it. I already thought my code looked pretty neat—my indentation was fine, my braces were lined up, spaces and commas were in the right places. So I figured, no big deal. But once I installed ESLint in VSCode, my so-called “perfect” code was suddenly full of squiggly lines and error messages. My first thought was, seriously? more errors? It definitely messed with me at first, because I just wanted my code to look clean and error-free, not covered in warnings. It even got a little frustrating when I was already stuck on something else and ESLint kept yelling at me.

## After Using It a Few Times
Once I started actually fixing the ESLint errors, I began to see the point. It caught things I never really noticed before, like making sure I used single quotes for strings, forcing me to use === instead of ==, or telling me to get rid of random spaces. None of that stops the code from running, but once I cleaned it up, the code just looked sharper. And I realized that if I’m working on a bigger project, these rules would make it way easier for other people (and future me) to understand and maintain the code.

## Final Reflection
In the end, I’ve come to see coding standards as more than just making code “look nice.” They actually shape the way you think and push you to build better habits. It’s still kind of annoying at times, but I can tell it’s worth it in the long run. If I had to pick one thing that really boosts code quality, I’d put coding standards at the top of the list.
