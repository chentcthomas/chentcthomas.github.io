## I. Introduction

For me, AI in ICS 314 felt more like a learning partner that I could constantly discuss ideas with, rather than a tool that simply completed assignments for me. Whenever I felt stuck or confused during the learning process, AI was able to offer different perspectives or possible directions that helped me reorganize my thoughts. However, it never made decisions for me. In the end, I still had to judge which suggestions were reasonable, which needed adjustment, and which were over-corrections. This process actually helped me better understand software engineering concepts.

When I struggled to understand certain system architectures, AI could explain them in a simple and approachable way. If I still did not fully understand, I could continue the discussion and gradually correct misunderstandings. Throughout this semester, I also witnessed how ChatGPT became more capable — from handling repetitive, supportive tasks to being able to complete entire assignments with only minimal guidance. I have to admit that without ChatGPT, it would have been much harder for me to complete ICS 314 as smoothly as I did.


## II. Personal Experience with AI

In this section, I explain my actual experiences using AI in ICS 314 and why the difficulty of this course would have increased significantly without it.



## Experience WODs

At the beginning, I was very determined not to rely on AI. However, I quickly realized that it was extremely difficult to fully understand the material and complete each WOD using only what was covered in lectures. Eventually, I compromised. I still tried my best to prevent AI from replacing my opportunity to learn new knowledge, but using AI to help me understand unfamiliar topics made the learning process much more efficient.

## In-class WODs

During the early part of the semester, I rarely used AI for in-class WODs. However, this course places heavy weight on training scores, and assignments are often graded as either 0 or 100. This created a lot of pressure for me, especially when I repeatedly received low scores, which caused significant anxiety. Later on, when I began using AI, I realized that the course might actually be encouraging us to learn how to use these new tools effectively. In the WOD completion process, AI appeared almost everywhere, allowing me to finish tasks within limited time.

## Essays

For essays, I mainly used ChatGPT for grammar correction and sentence refinement rather than content generation. A common prompt I used was:
“Please revise this paragraph to improve grammar and clarity without changing the original meaning.” AI was very helpful in making my writing clearer and more natural, but all ideas and viewpoints were still my own. I believe most people, like me, do not want to read essays that are completely written by AI without any human thinking involved.

## Final Project
Because the final project integrated multiple technologies, unclear error messages and unexpected behaviors were common during development. During these moments, I used ChatGPT as a supporting tool to help me understand framework behavior, identify possible causes of errors, and analyze database relationships.

For example, when implementing authentication, I encountered an issue where users were constantly redirected back to the login page when trying to access protected routes. Through continuous discussion with ChatGPT and checking the possible causes it suggested, I eventually discovered that the issue was caused by incorrect environment variable configuration. This experience helped me understand the overall authentication flow rather than simply fixing a single bug.

## Learning New Concepts

When learning new software engineering concepts, such as React, I often asked AI to explain them in simpler terms or provide additional examples and possible use cases. This significantly reduced the amount of time I needed to search for examples on my own and lowered the learning barrier. However, I also believe that controlling how much AI intervenes is critical. I consciously avoid letting AI take away my opportunity to think, even though relying on AI is the easiest and fastest option. Without this restraint, it would be impossible to truly learn anything in this course.

## Answering Questions in Class or on Discord

I rarely asked questions on Discord unless they were related to assignment submission or logistics. In most other cases, asking AI was simply more efficient and less stressful.

## Coding Examples

I frequently used AI to look up examples of libraries or elements, which was very helpful for improving my coding skills and understanding how certain APIs work.

## Explaining Code

When it comes to explaining code, AI outperformed almost all human assistance. It could explain the purpose of each keyword in the code in detail. It was also extremely helpful when trying to understand large codebases and quickly grasp changes made to the project.

## Writing Code

During hands-on WODs, I often used AI to help generate large portions of code. This was especially useful in time-pressured testing environments.

## Documenting Code

AI can generate documentation very efficiently, but the results often require revision. It sometimes lacks full understanding of the code or produces overly verbose explanations. Still, overall efficiency is higher, simply because AI types much faster than I do.

## Quality Assurance

I frequently used AI to perform repetitive testing tasks. However, it often struggled to precisely understand the intended testing scope. The most effective approach was to first design a clear testing checklist myself, then let AI execute parts of it, followed by manual verification. Without human oversight, results were often unreliable.

## Other Uses

All other uses have already been covered above.

## III. Impact on Learning and Understanding

Overall, AI provided significant support for all of my coursework. It acted as an entity I could debate with and helped stimulate ideas during design discussions. At the same time, it required strong self-discipline to avoid over-reliance. When used intentionally, AI clearly strengthened my understanding and problem-solving abilities.

## IV. Practical Applications

These experiences showed me that AI is most valuable in practice when it helps reduce the time spent figuring out where a problem exists, rather than directly providing final solutions. When combined with my own judgment, AI significantly improved both development efficiency and depth of understanding.

## V. Challenges and Opportunities

The biggest challenge with AI is that it does not always understand project context or assignment constraints. Whether in documentation, quality assurance, or code suggestions, AI can provide responses that appear reasonable but are not actually applicable. Therefore, consciously stepping away from AI to work independently is essential to avoid blindly trusting generated content without critical thinking.

## VI. Comparative Analysis
Compared to traditional learning methods that rely on lectures and documentation, AI offers an interactive and immediate learning experience. Instead of interrupting the learning flow to search for answers, students can quickly obtain explanations or examples. However, traditional learning methods remain irreplaceable in developing patience, logical reasoning, and independent problem-solving skills. I believe traditional teaching allows students to build a more complete understanding of knowledge.

## VII. Future Considerations

I believe future courses should provide clearer guidance on when AI should be used and when it should be avoided. This would help students gradually build judgment and responsibility. Otherwise, AI may become the biggest obstacle to learning rather than a benefit.

## VIII. Conclusion
In conclusion, AI in ICS 314 was not a replacement for learning but a partner that supported my thinking and helped clarify problems. It allowed me to keep moving forward in a high-pressure, fast-paced course, but real learning still came from understanding, correcting mistakes, and continuous reflection.

Through this course, I not only learned software engineering techniques and workflows, but also how to communicate and collaborate with AI. AI is powerful, but without knowing how to use it, it becomes nothing more than a useless piece of metal on the side of the road. While AI can sometimes hinder deep skill development, completely isolating ourselves from it is unrealistic. At this stage of learning, it is important to preserve space for independent thinking, take control of AI usage, and avoid over-dependence.
