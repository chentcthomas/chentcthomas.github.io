## Introduction

For me, ICS 314 was not just a class about how to write code, but a class that made me rethink what programming actually means. In the past, when I wrote code, I mainly focused on whether the functionality worked and whether I could submit the assignment on time. I rarely thought about whether the code would be easy to maintain later, or whether other people could clearly understand what I was writing. Throughout this course, as we worked through the project step by step, I started to realize that software development involves much more than just writing code. It also includes collaboration, code quality, and making sure others can understand your work.

This class also gave me more confidence when thinking about future projects or opportunities, because I began to develop a more complete way of approaching software development. One concept in particular that had a strong impact on me was Open Source Programming.

## Open Source Programming

Before taking this course, my understanding of open source was very limited. I knew that many projects had public code, but I did not really understand what that development style actually involved. Through my experience in this class, I began to see that open source programming is more about collaboration than simply putting code online.

In an open source environment, code needs to be readable and usable by people with different backgrounds, which makes clear structure and documentation very important. Using platforms like GitHub allows multiple people to work on the same project at the same time, while also keeping track of changes and history. This process not only improves efficiency, but also helps keep the project organized.

What helped me the most was how this approach changed the way I think about who I am writing code for. When code is no longer just for personal use, but may be read and continued by others, it naturally encourages more careful and organized coding. I believe this habit will be very useful for me in any future collaborative projects.

## Conclusion

Overall, ICS 314 helped me understand that software engineering is not something that can be achieved through technical skills alone. Concepts like open source programming may seem basic at first, but they have a long-term impact on how software is developed.

Although these ideas can be learned in other ways, working with real projects throughout the course made it much easier for me to turn them into habits. This class not only improved my technical skills, but also helped me mature in how I think about and approach development work. These are lessons I will continue to carry with me beyond the classroom.
